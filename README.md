# 16x16-Connect-Four

Classic game of Connect Four on a 16×16 LED array.

## Instructions
- Begin the game by flipping switch 9 up and back down to reset the system.  
- Player 1 goes first by flipping switch (0–7) on, showing the two token drop options (left and right).  
- Pressing the left two keys (2 and 3) will drop the token beneath the left drop option, and pressing the right two keys (0 and 1) will drop the token beneath the right drop option.  
- Once the key is pressed, the color will switch and Player 2 takes their turn the exact same way.  
- This process is continued until one of the players gets four in a row (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal), and then the board resets.  
- Score is shown on the hex display. The first player to 5 wins—which will be indicated by the flashing of their player symbol (“P1” or “P2”).  
- Once a player reaches 5, the board will reset and the game begins again.
